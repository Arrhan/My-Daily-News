# News-Digest
Building out a project, where I news scrape articles from a list of credible news websites/blogs in topics relating to the economy, finance, technology, startups, business and others. This list will be automated to update daily to provide the latest information in these fields. Furthermore, I plan to take data from these articles to perform sentiment analysis on trending topics using machine learning and NLP along with data visualizations. Finally, I plan to host this online on website and add user functionality where users can creater their own accounts and recieve news tailored to their preferences.

## Features
- Top articles on various topics web scraped from reliable sites and blogs (updated daily)
- Sentiment analysis + data visualizations on trending topics based on scraped data
- Hosted on a website with customisable user preferences

## Possible updates
- Build reccomendation system for users utilizing on machine learning
- Expand on user engagment features allowing them to comment/like/share articles
