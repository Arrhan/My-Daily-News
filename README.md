# News-Digest
I often find myself spenging a lot of time searching for and reading news articles evryday to stay up to date with current events. So I decided to build "My Daily News" where I aggregate news articles using certain keywords based on my criteria for reading a news article. I news scrape articles from a list of credible news websites/blogs and utilizing News API to find articles in topics of my interest This list will be automated to update daily to provide the latest information in these fields. Furthermore, I plan to take data from these articles, twitter and facebook to perform sentiment analysis on certian topics I am interested in using machine learning and NLP along with data visualizations.
