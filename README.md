# My Daily News
I often find myself spending a lot of time searching for news articles everyday in order to stay up to date with current events. To optimize my time spent searching for articles I decided to pursue this project. Here I aggregate news articles using certain keywords based on my criteria for reading a news article. I news scrape articles from a list of credible news websites/blogs and utilize various APIs including Media stack, News API and PRAW (Python wrapper for Reddit's API) to find articles that may interest me. This task will be automated to update daily to provide the latest articles and news. Furthermore, I plan to take data from these articles, twitter and facebook to perform sentiment analysis on topics of my interest, to gauge public opinion, by using machine learning and NLP. 

This is a project simply to help me optimize my time spent searching for articles to help me update myself about current events and enhance my understanding of the world around me.

I decided to build this project as a part of my ECE 220 honors project.
